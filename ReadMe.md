This project was completed at the end of week 15.
Our team of 4 was given 8 days to build a full-stack e-commerce
website using JavaScript, MySQL and newly learned technologies such as sequelize, Node.js and Express.js.
We were able to complete a good amount of the functionality we wanted in the short time period we had.
