This project was completed at the end of week 15.
Our team of 4 was given 8 days to build a full-stack e-commerce
website using JavaScript, MySQL and newly learned technologies such as sequelize, Node.js and Express.js.
We were able to complete a good amount of the functionality we wanted in the short time period we had.
The idea behind the website was an herbal store. Customers could view the products but could only
add to cart and purchase if they were logged in.
